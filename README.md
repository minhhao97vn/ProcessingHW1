- When using elevator, we usually want to choose destinations as quickly as possible: Floor button -> Closing button. A well designed interface will help people interact much easier.
- Most elevators use buttons and symbols on them to help users figure out how to use them. LED display and sound are used to help users realize their choice.

Suggestions:
- Use the touch screen to help users make choices easier.
- Show more information on the electronic screen such as date, time, next floor, moving direction of the elevator.
